The OpenAccess.CodeFirst NuGet package is designed for projects containing classes 
that are stored using OpenAccess ORM.

It provides the assembly references and project enhancements made by the 
OpenAccess ORM Enhancer tool during the build process, required by 
Telerik OpenAccess ORM runtime.

If you need a NuGet package for a project only consuming OpenAccess ORM model
from another assembly, the OpenAccess.Core NuGet package which contains the 
OpenAccess ORM runtime assemblies necessary to work with OpenAccess persistent 
objects is sufficient and can be used instead.

Telerik OpenAccess ORM helps defining mapping and executing create, retrieve, 
update and delete operations for your data access classes and database tables. 
It allows you to consume stored procedures and functions.
